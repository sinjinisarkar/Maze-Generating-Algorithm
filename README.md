# Maze Game and Generator

# Summary
This project is a simple Maze Game implemented in C. Players navigate through a maze loaded from a file, starting at a designated point (S) and making their way to the exit (E). The game takes user input for movement (WASD) and displays the maze on request, marking the player's current position (X).

1) gcc maze.c -o maze
2) gcc mazegen.c -o mazegen
